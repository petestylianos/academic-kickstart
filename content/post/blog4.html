<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this blog-post I will review a new R package named <strong><a href="https://github.com/etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-j-effendy">covidexplorer</a></strong> authored by my colleague Jimmy Effendy. This package was developed as part of an assignment for unit ETC5523: Communicating with Data; a core unit in the master of <strong><a href="https://www.monash.edu/business/master-of-business-analytics">Business Analytics at Monash University</a></strong>. The main purpose of the package is to launch a Shiny app that allows the user to explore data relating to COVID-19. More specifically, the Shiny app a provides users with insights of the spread of COVID-19 in the US through interactive plots and tables.</p>
<p>For more inforamtion you can refer to this <a href="https://github.com/etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-j-effendy">link</a>, or use the below browser.</p>

<h2>Expectations vs. Reality</h2>
<div id="expected" class="section level3">
<h3>Expected</h3>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\color{green}\checkmark\)</span> <strong>Installation</strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::install_github(&quot;etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-j-effendy&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Of to a good start. The package was installed quickly and without any errors or warnings.<br />
Now let’s look at the exported datasets and functions.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\color{green}\checkmark\)</span> <strong>Datasets</strong></p>
<p>ALl datasets can be accessed and their relevant documentation offers explanations about their variables and it is very thorough and accurate.</p>
<p>For reference the package exports three datasets named:</p>
<ul>
<li>covid: USA COVID-19 Data</li>
<li>state_list: USA State List.</li>
<li>usa_map: USA Map Data.</li>
</ul>
<p>More info on how to use them can be found <a href="https://etc5523-2020.github.io/r-package-assessment-j-effendy/index.html">here</a></p>
<p>The final step is to check the exported functions,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\color{red}\bigotimes\)</span> <strong>launch_app()</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t get the app to launch as I was getting an error.</p>
</div>
<div id="reality" class="section level3">
<h3>Reality</h3>
<p><strong>Error Produced when using covidexplorer::launch_app()</strong></p>
<p><code>here() starts at /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.0/Resources/library/covidexplorer</code>
<code>Warning in readChar(con, 5L, useBytes = TRUE) : cannot open compressed file</code> <code>/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.0/Resources/library/covidexplorer/data/covid.rda',</code>
<code>probable reason 'No such file or directory'</code>
<code>Error in readChar(con, 5L, useBytes = TRUE) : cannot open the connection</code></p>
<p>So, unfortunately I am not able to review the app inside the package.</p>
<p>However, I should mention that the <strong>error</strong> is not probably significant and it is due to a missing <strong>.rda</strong> object that I am sure will be fixed in a future update. Perhps the script that produces the shiny app needs to source this dataset at the beginning.</p>

<div id="suggestions" class="section level2">
<h2>Suggestions</h2>
<p>Other than resolving the issue with the launch_app() function, let’s see on what else can be further improved. The documentation of the package is excellent and details are provided for every function.
I would suggest adding the link to the vignettes site next to the repository on GitHub in the <em>About</em> section.
Unfortunately, I can’t provide any constructive feedback for the shiny app since I can’t launch it.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-i-learned" class="section level2">
<h2>What I learned</h2>
<p>In conclusion, it is evident that Jimmy put a lot of effort in developing this package and thoroughly documenting everything. Based on, what I see in the README the shiny app also provides many insights on the state of coronavirus in USA. What I learned is how prone R packages are to errors and how hard might be to debug them. I am guessing that the package worked perfectly for Jimmy at his local system, but a problem arises when somebody else downloads it from <em>GitHub</em>. The fact that I encouraged similar problems when I developed mine(without knowing if they are fixed at the moment) <strong>highlights</strong> the importance of developing packages in <strong>collaboration</strong> with others cause the burden of doing all the work at your own might be overwhelming, especially in the first stages of your development career.</p>
<p>Kudos to Jimmy Effendy for his hard work!! Can’t wait to see more of his next work.</p>
